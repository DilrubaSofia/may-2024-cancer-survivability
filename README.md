# May-2024-Cancer-Survivability
This is a project conducted by the May-2024-Cancer-Survivability group at the Erdos Institute Data Science Boot Camp (May 2024 Cohort).

The goal of this project is to develop models which can accurately classify breast cancer patient outcomes as either "alive" or "dead", based on demographic data and clinical data at the time of diagnosis.
