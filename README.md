# May-2024-Cancer-Survivability
This is a project conducted by the May-2024-Cancer-Survivability group at the Erdos Institute Data Science Boot Camp (May 2024 Cohort).

The goal of this project is to develop models which can accurately classify breast cancer patient outcomes as either "alive" or "dead", based on demographic data and clinical data at the time of diagnosis.

The code "cancer_data_processing" was used for data pre-processing. A classification model for disease outcome is developed in "final_experiment". A classification model for disease outcome at specified time intervals post-diagnosis is developed in "experiment_time_frames".

Our data is obtained from the data repository provided by the National Cancer Institute: https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/.
